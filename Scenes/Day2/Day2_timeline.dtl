Alright, sure.. thing?
[i]Wow. First thing in the morning and this guy already wants a smoke huh?[/i]
[i]Mr. Satabi has always been a weird one, but to see him this early in the morning is certainly strange.[/i]
[i] I try to avoid interacting with him as much as I can, but with this situation I’m in, that may no longer be a possibility.[/i]

TamBai: Hoy Mari! I thought you quit smoking long ago?
It’s not for me, idiot. Anyway, how long have you been here?
TamBai: Long enough to see you stare down that box of Marlboro like you wanna make out with it.
Like. I. Said. It’s not for me.
I see you’ve got Ace with you today again. Have you two always been this close?
TamBai: Huh? Yeah of course.. Why do you ask?
TamBai: Isn’t that right, Ace?
Ace: …yeah sure.
Oh! Feel like talking today Ace? Feeling better perhaps?

	Alright! Tam, I’m back with your drinks. What was Mr. Satabi even saying?
	TamBai: Nothing to worry about, told him to piss off na, he's just being a bum as usual.
	TamBai: Palagi ko nalang ‘yan nakikita sa labas, pagala-gala kahit gabi na.
	He’s always out?
	TamBai: Oo, kahit noon pa.
	TamBai: It’s a pain in the ass hanging around here with his stinky face in the area.
	TamBai: Anyway, the computer shop opens late today, so is it cool if me and Ace hang out here for a while?
	Stay as long as you like.
